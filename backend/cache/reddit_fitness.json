    "text": "Homemade Baby Crib inspired by the $10k one my wife saw the Kardashians all buy\nMy wife’s dream was for me to make our daughter’s crib and hit me with a design clearly made by CNC.\n\nMy little garage shop stood the challenge and lucky for me both my girls love the finished product!\n\nI originally had the vision to vlog this and had recorded my way through the process up until our little angel decided to arrive 10 weeks early.  All the long days and night back and forth to the NICU took the wind out of my sails to continue recording but I knew I had to finish the build regardless.\n\nI started by making a sample template for the side pieces, and for the curved pieces.  I accomplished this by drawing it in CAD and then printing them to scale.  I glued them to a sheet of plywood and rough cut them.  I then used a belt sander to polish the curves to be smooth and precise.\n\nNext, I made 4 simple jigs to allow me to copy these profiles with ease on my router table.  2 for each of the templates (1= inside profile and ends, 2= outside)\n\nAfter buying $800 of Hard Maple and Leopard Wood, I started making the real shavings!  I hand traced all the parts on the boards, and since I don’t have a bandsaw, I jig sawed each individually piece out while staying proud of the traced lines.\n\nMy little jointer and surface planer were next up to make a mess.  I made all the Hard Maple side pieces flat, parallel and consistent thickness.  For the rails (top= Leopard Wood, bottom= Hard Maple) I started by just surfacing 2 sides without straight wide boards.  I then ripped the boards to the approximate width  they would finish at.  For the curved rails, I made 5 segments with precise mitered cuts.  I then added 2 dowel holes to each joint in specific locations so that after glue up and routing they would remain hidden.\n\nMy first jig finished the ends and inside profile, then I was able to use these fresh cut surfaces to locate with on the second jig to complete the outside profile.\n\nEstablishing a process to commit to for gluing the curved assemblies took me some time.  I ended up using spring miter clamps on the outside joints allowing the tips to bite in to the hardwood in areas that will be removed in routing.  I then used a bar clamp across the tips of the 2 ends to keep the pressure against the inside ends of the joints.  I completed the process by placing the glue up on a flat melamine board and used two 30lb dumbbells to hold the faces against the melamine.  This worked surprisingly very well and required only minimal scraping/sanding.  Although I’ve seen pieces like this pushed through jointers and planers, I really focused on doing everything I could to prevent having to do such.  Glad it worked.\n\n(This is the point baby girl sent us to the hospital 😅)\n\nI then used the 3rd jig to again finish the ends and inside profile of the curved rails.  Followed up with the 4th jig to locate these cut ends to finish the outside profile.\n\nRound over bits came next and I took my time softening all edges that were not mating faces during assembly.\n\nThe next complicated hurdle was to make angled notches in the lower rails since the side pieces mate to the rail where they had an 11 degree profile.  I wish I had taken pics of the jig I made but this was accomplished with accurate layout and the router table again.\n\nThe final cuts needed were to drill the dowel holes at the ends of each side piece, as well as on the bottom of all the Leopard Wood rails.  Additionally I had to drill the holes for the curved and straight rails (top and bottom) to be secure to each other.  For this I used furniture style barrels and pin which have a tapered set screw that press into the pins to hold the joints together.  Finally, I laid out each of the mattress height holes on select pieces, and completed them by installing threaded inserts.\n\nI spent about 50hrs hand sanding each of the 50 side pieces and rails from 120 grit, 180 grit, 220 grit and finished at 300 grit.\n\nAfter extracting all the sawdust out of the garage, I then pulled out my pop up canopy and tarped it off as my spray booth.  I made sure to move the cars out of the driveway and used a cheap box fan to help pull the vapors outside.  I used 6 coats of lacquer on all of the Hard Maple, and 20 on the Leopard wood.  Lucky for me my wife loaned me her portable wardrobe rack which allowed me to hang all the pieces after being sprayed with each coat.\n\nAssembly was simple, and even easier the second time when I realized the assembled crib wouldn’t fit through the bedroom door😅.  I completed the build with a plywood mattress platform that I shaped to match the inside profile of the assembled crib.  I used steel L- brackets which uses 2 bolts each bracket to mate to the select side pieces with the thread inserts.\n\n——————-\n\nIf you’ve made it this far I thank you very much for your interest.  This was an incredible memory and opportunity to get to have and I just hope this can help inspire anyone else with a little bit of tools to make something just as special.  I am more than happy to answer any questions!",

    "text": "(37) Got healthy for surgery tomorrow, getting a proctectomy\nI’ve posted a few progress pics over the last few months but tomorrow is my surgery day and just finished my final workout before surgery this is the culmination of my hard work. \n\nTomorrow i’m having a complete proctectomy to remove my rectal stump and anus, the final step in my battle with ulcerative colitis. My large intestine was removed in 2019, but the disease then returned in the stump, this led to me having both a stoma but also bleeding and leaking from the rectal stump still, making my stoma bag permanent and requiring this surgery. \n\nAfter years of emergency blood transfusions, intravenous biologics, and public accidents, I’ll finally be disease-free after tomorrow. To prep for recovery, I transformed my body: from 308 lbs (45% body fat) to 154 lbs (17% body fat), losing 154 lbs in ~18 months (Jan 2024–now). I shed most of the weight in the first 9 months and have been maintaining a lean physique and trying to body recomposition since Nov 2024.\n\nI started at 1200 calories/day for weight loss, tracked via MyFitnessPal. Since Nov 2024, I’ve been on 2800 calories/day (280g protein, 280g carbs, 53g fat) to maintain and build muscle, focusing on high-protein, IBD-friendly foods.\n\nI got healthy by walking 18k steps/9 miles day with my dog in the hills, plus 1 hour of free weights every morning before work (just basic exercises using 40kg adjustable  dumbbells, 32kg kettle bell and a bench ).\n\nMentally adjusting to a stoma was tough which led to the initial weight gain, I was worried what people would think and say and got insecure. Then I had a manager at an old job lash out and ask me if I needed to change my diaper embarrassing me infront of lots of other colleagues purely because I’d pointed out how they were wrong on something and it caused me to spiral. \n\nHowever now I am used to it I realise I should have got it sooner. I was told I needed a stoma in 2008 but turned it down because I thought it would put off girls, but getting it earlier would’ve spared me a decade of pain and embarrassment. Now, I see it as a lifeline that has changed my life for the better.\n\nPost-proctectomy, I’ll have a “Barbie Butt” (permanent closure) and will aim to maintain my strength during recovery, hopefully won’t need too long off and can ease back into exercise soon with resistance bands rather than weights. \n\nI want to show others that a stoma isn’t a limitation—it’s a life saver. If I’d embraced it in 2008, I could’ve felt better for years and not got so unhealthy in the first place so I want to show people you can be active and happy with a stoma.",

    "text": "Dog bit home intruder, intruder's mother threatening to sue for medical costs\n**I am not The OOP, OOP is u/dogbitethrowaway123**\n\n**Dog bit home intruder, intruder's mother threatening to sue for medical costs**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!breaking and entering!< \n\n**MOOD SPOILER:**  >!triumphant and the goodest boy ever is still a good boy!<\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/CtSGGCRF4n)  **Aug 12, 2017**\n\nThrowaway for obv reasons but I live in an older home a stones throw away from frat row in a party school college town. Just over a year ago a college student drunkenly entered my home via throwing his weight at my 150 year old wooden door at around 1:00 AM. When he entered he woke us up, and startled our large dog who was most likely sleeping on the floor by the front door. The dog bit him, drew blood, and college student needed stitches. \n\nWhen we heard him entering the home we called the police, who did a great job of coming quickly. They administered medical care to him and one set of officers took him to the ER while another set got a statement from us, we pulled our vaccine records for the dog, gave him the name to the vet, and so on. The next day they called to let us know that they had checked with the vet and everything about our dog was ship shape and the dog was obviously contained appropriately and has no bite record so they didn't impound him or anything and chalked it up to \"doggie justice.\" \n\nThey dealt with the student, too, and communicated with us throughout the process and after all the court dates he received a fine and a misdemeanor. We did not attempt to escalate, as college student was drunk, was stupid, had no prior record and hopefully learned from the experience (and our dog). Door and frame got replaced (and strengthened with another lock - we had no idea how brittle that door was!) \n\nThis week, over a year later, we got a letter from a lawyer representing the student and his mom saying we can settle for the cost of the dog bite expenses (which they did not itemize or send a copy of the bill for or anything, just put the number on a letter) or they will sue us for the cost + legal fees. My husband and I can't see how this can possibly hold up in court considering he was technically breaking and entering and did receive a misdemeanor for that. \n\nMy question is...do we even need a lawyer for this? Or can we just say \"see you in court!\" and represent ourselves with a copy of the police report from the break + enter? We're sort of regretting letting it go so easily now. Ugh. How can he possibly sue us for the cost of the stitches and ER bill when he was criminally trespassing in our house and breaking our door down? It's not like our dog was outside running around unsupervised or even on a leash or something. He's not an aggressive dog at all and had never before and never since bit anyone. I feel like he and his mom watched one of those ambulance chasing lawyer commercials and took the bait. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**thepatman**\n\n>\"Or can we just say \"see you in court!\" and represent ourselves\"\n\n>Representing yourselves is a bad idea, even in a case that otherwise seems open and shut. In this case, you're not yet being sued, so you don't *have* to do anything. You should inform your homeowner's insurance of the letter - they will likely handle it from there. \n\n>\"How can he possibly sue us for the cost of the stitches and ER bill when he was criminally trespassing in our house and breaking our door down?\"\n\n>\"He was trespassing\" doesn't automatically excuse everything that happened. It's entirely possible for you both to have been wrong - him for B&E, you for having a dangerous dog or something. Your particular situation doesn't seem like that, from your re-telling, but such things aren't terribly uncommon.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>Ok, Sounds good - we will contact a lawyer on Monday. We paid one for advice when the student initially broke in to make sure we had our bases covered and had representation in case we needed to go to court (we did not - our lawyer went on our behalf with written statements from us) and we will reach out to him again and then go from there\n\n**TOP COMMENT**\n\n**TheShadowCat**\n\n>If he got probation, I would send the letter to his probation officer.  They tend to frown on criminals trying to shake down their victims.\n\n>And tell your dog what a good boy he is.\n\n**~**\n\n**northshore21**\n\n>My guess is the kid lied to his parent about breaking into your home . I would bring a copy of the police report & any back up you have to an attorney to write a response to their attorney.\n\n**Hargbarglin**\n\n>>That's where my mind goes. The kid spins his heroes journey about how the vicious out of control dog mutilated him. His mother believes him and wants justice.\n\nEdit: I'm hesitant to say where I live because it becomes way too easy to google if I do.\n\nEdit2: Woah! There's a lot of responses! Thanks for the advice everyone! At this point we've made up our minds to speak to the lawyer we had from the initial case last year. We'll call him on Monday and update after that conversation. \n\nSome answers to questions:\n\n * We are the homeowners.\n\n * We paid out of pocket for the replacement door and door frame, and we also replaced our side and rear doors and frames with matching doors when we realized how easy it was to get into our house by forcing the door. This was in the low five figures - we took it out of our emergency fund and did not go through homeowners. There was a restitution order but it was not enough to cover the doors that we wanted, labor, and door frames (we live in a historic home and wanted to keep with the character). We have lived in a historic home for most of our marriage so we know to keep cash on hand for pipe leaks, furnaces going out, and now...door replacements. \n\n * We tell our dog he's a good boy every day, don't you worry! He is the goodest boy!\n\nEdit 3: I can't figure out how to get those asterisks to look like bullet points! What am I doing wrong??\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Comments from when this was crossposted to BoLA**\n\n**Letmefixthatforyouyo**\n\n>Ehh. Sometimes people cut strangers some slack. Being drunk and stupid is a near universal experience, although the violent B&E is generally not. Still, I can understand feeling like bite + fine/misdemeanor is enough for someone who wasn't otherwise violent. \n\n**28f272fe556a1363cc31**\n\n>>There is being drunk and stupid, and then there is breaking down a strangers door in the middle of the night. \n\n**Letmefixthatforyouyo**\n\n>>>Sure, at which point his hand was lacerated by a dog bite, he was arrested, and was sentenced to both a fine and some kind of restitution. They could have pushed for more, but they said \"well, okay. Thats probably even for the shock of the event, and for the cost of the door.\"  \n\n>>>You are free to disagree, but I dont think OPs choice was unreasonable. This time, it just happened to come back to bite them in the ass. \n\n**OOP**\n\n>>>>It's pretty much this - my husband and I have worked at the university in this college town for a while now. We have seen stupidity (though this is the first time someone has come into our house because of it!) for as long as we've lived in that house. We wanted to give the kid the benefit of the doubt, and we wanted to give him a fighting shot at a good adulthood. Criminal records follow people around in serious ways and we both believed that the punishment fit the incident at the time. We actually had a friend in our peer group when we were in our early twenties and thirties who did something similar when he was in his late teens (wandered in drunk to someone's home) about twenty years ago and it became a felony. He struggled to find employment for years as a bright, sober (he never drank again after that), young man and watching him lose out on job after job because he had to say he was a felon for breaking and entering for years after the incident shaped our decision not to push it with this guy. \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/XOLE8mtSPG)  **Aug 16, 2017 (4 days later)**\n\n[Update] Dog bit home intruder, intruder's mother threatening to sue for medical costs\n\nQuick update to this - it was easily handled. We met with our lawyer on Monday and paid him outright to draft a letter and include documentation of fault (basically the police report, restitution order, court documents, etc.) and also the vet records that include the police check in and vaccine records for the dog. My vet wrote down when the police called him and why they called him and my lawyer's secretary grabbed a copy of that for this. (Why he is including this I don't know but if anyone has any ideas why this would be important let me know...). He did not want to include the bills and orders for the door at this time but took a copy just in case we needed to move further. This morning the student's mom's lawyer who sent the initial letter called our lawyer and said that the family would no longer be pursuing restitution for medical expenses and that we could expect a letter from him stating that would arrive at both the lawyers office and our house within the week. \n\nTurns out that those of you who guessed that the student didn't tell his mom why and how he got bitten by our dog are probably correct. It wasn't explicitly said during the phone call but my lawyer relayed that he could infer it from the way the conversation with the other lawyer went. This probably made his top ten stupid cases list. \n\nThanks again for the advice and help! \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

Her family says she is happier than ever, she has always wanted a clean house and car (but fights me when I clean up, even now, as she was about to do it).\n\n I am miserable. I am constantly picking up the car, the yard, the house. I let it go two days once and got screamed at for sabotaging her.\n\nI talked to a lawyer myself. Not to move forward but to protect myself.\n\nMy boss actually has me in line for a promotion. Which is great, only problem is if our marriage ends and she and moves back to California then I would be stuck in a 2 year deal at work.\n\n So I am currently very nervous about career advancement when I am miserable personally\n\n\n\nEdit: forgot to add the \"cheating\" part. She confessed she was nervous I would cheat because I am \"not the ugliest guy around and you work hard, so if you hate me then you would have options\". I have no idea if she is cheating, and I am kind of at a point when I don't care. I am 100% checked out\n\n\nEdit 2:\n\nSo many responses.\n\nWhy haven't I cut the cord? Because she is my wife and we said for better or worse. How can I walk away from her when she is not doing OK without giving it the good old college try? Plus I was raised divorce is not an option. I gave myself until Christmas 2026, if it's not better then, I am pulling the plug.\n\n\nI am picking up everyday because counseling said it would help, and also as people rightfully pointed out last time my daughter doesn't deserve this. I want a clean home, so I do it myself. Is it defeating to come home everyday and the kitchen table is covered with random stuff she got out because she was \"going to bake\" but never did, and the bed is covered with totes of clothes she was \"going to sort\", sure. Do I want to go through the guest room every 3 days because she destroys it (not figuratively but gets stuff out in it or brings things into it) and I want it to be guest ready at all times, no, I don't, but it's the price I pay. If I don't do it, our house is shit, and our kid doesn't deserve it. If I leave, i am hurting someone with mental illness. All I am doing right now is destroying someone (myself). And when I finally walk away, I can HONESTLY say I did my best...\n\n\nYes I am documenting her car and the house when I get home and when I leave. I am probably enabling right now, but if it goes the way it probably will, I am going to be fighting to keep my daughter. Part of this going above and beyond is so that I can be the better parent, because people before we're right, I wasn't protecting my kid\n\nAs for her claiming I am.sabotaging, I must have worded it wrong. When I clean up she is mad because she was \"going to do it in a minute\" even though it's been days.\n\n\nThose wondering about work, I am full time, she works full time now as a teacher, started back a few days ago. I had hoped she would stay home full time to raise our daughter as that's why I took this job (dont.love it, don't enjoy.it, but it pays the bills and provides a good QOL), but it's what she says she needs.\n\n\nAnd for the people messaging me about using the word boot, I am from Arkansas but there is this thing called a plane, and I have worked all over and have even enjoyed a TV show or 2 that wasn't Walker Texas Ranger. I also call carts at the stores trolleys, partly to mess with people and partly because it entertains me, and mainly because it's become a habit.",

We have three teenage kids. Until recently, I would have said we had a wonderful marriage. But as I look back, I think out of pure love and obsession, I’ve been looking at things with rose colored glasses.\n\nWe met in college. Her best friend went to the same college as me and that’s how we met. She had a tough upbringing. Her mom was very young was she born and her parents were never married. She didn’t meet her biological dad until she was in her 30s, which is story for another day. Her mom isn’t really a good person and they are no contact with one another. Until my wife was a teenager, she shared a bed room with her mother in her grandparents house; they were more like sisters.\n\nWhen she a teenager, her mom got married to another awful person. She had an affair with a married guy. Eventually he got divorced and married my MIL. He had two kids, who were slightly older than my wife. Imagine what that was like: merge two families with teenage kids, their dad cheated on their mother and then shack them all up in one house. I can’t imagine.\n\nThere are countless stories of the horrors my wife went through as a child. Her mom told her she should have aborted her, tried to push her out of a moving car, there were smacks and slaps. My wife was never complimented growing up. I have never heard my MIL compliment my wife. My wife was always smart, did well in school, didn’t get in trouble, helped around the house, cooked for her family, she was and is very pretty. Her mother only criticized her and it was constant. As if that wasn’t bad enough, she was sexually assaulted in college by some friend of her stepbrother. To say that this has taken a mental toll is the understatement of the century. I have loved her with every sense of my being, have supported her, supported her in her therapy. I am by no means a perfect husband, but I have tried my best to be supportive and loving.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to today. I’ve been married for over 20 years. My wife obviously has a lot of issues stemming from the above. I love her more than anything in the world, but it hasn’t been easy. I’ve born the brunt of some pretty outlandish treatment and I’m wondering if I have been blinded by love and if this is not a safe and healthy environment for me. I don’t know if I could ever leave, don’t know if I could do that to her or do that to my kids. But I’m starting to feel like I am only here to serve the purpose of providing support: financial, emotional, physical, parenting….\n\nHere are some of the things that have happened.\n\nAbout 5 years ago, we had gone to a beach location for a long weekend with a lifelong friend of mine and his family. It was an all around great time. One night, while we were leaving an amusement park, we were walking with the kids for ice cream. We walked past a bar and a baseball game was ending. My friend and I say to the wives that we want to grab a drink and watch the end of the game, while they get ice cream next door. Everyone seemed fine with it. This is something I never do. My friend and I were gone 20-30 mins. \n\nWhen we got home, my wife lost it. Couldn’t believe I abandoned the family (for a half hour tops while they ate ice cream). This was the first time she hit me. She punched me four times and threw a chair at me. I was shocked. This pattern escalated over the next few months. She slammed the shower door on me, breaking it and effectively trapping me, naked, in the shower. If she hadn’t brought me a screw driver to remove the shower door, I’d still be in there. \n\nRight before the holidays in 2019, 4 months after this hitting started, my wife had a disagreement with my daughter. My wife made a mistake and said something she shouldn’t have. It should have been easily fixable with a quick apology, but my wife turned it into WW3 with my daughter (which I thought was unnecessary but my wife and I put up a unified front with our kids and address things later). After my daughter went to her room punished, my wife and I went into our room. I tried to calm my wife down, but apparently she wanted me to match her level of outrage and my wife unleashed the fury on me. She punched me countless time. I ended up with a bloody nose and cut beneath my eye. I am over six feet tall and a pretty fit guy. My wife is almost a foot shorter than me and maybe 80 lbs lighter than me. I sat there and let her punch me countless times. I remember being frozen and also being afraid. I didn’t even want to grab her hands out of fear I would be blamed for the fight and arrested. She was unhinged, screaming as she pummeled me. It was awful. It was really fun to coach my daughter’s basketball game with a badly bruised and cut up face the next day.\n\nAfter this, I freaked out. I realized the situation had gotten way out of hand. My wife apologized profusely. I said I couldn’t go on like this. Our kids heard the commotion, and we later had to talk to them about it. I told my wife this wasn’t safe for me. She had a near break down out of fear I would leave her. She discussed with her therapist. We went to couple’s therapy for the first time. It was a mess. I’ve come to realize that therapists (or at least the ones we have seen), focus on the patient with the most needs. Given my wife’s past, she has the most mental health issues and so that is where the focus was. It was really hard to be put on the back burner. COVID came and the couple’s therapy stopped. We tried again last year and that was worse for the same reasons.\n\nWhat else has this marriage been like? Well, we’ve always been very sexually active. My wife is very beautiful. She gets attention anywhere she goes, although she usually seems oblivious to it. I sometimes feel infatuated with her. But she grew up with a mother that hated her and constantly took her down. I have always complimented her. Her beauty, her intellect, how wonderful of a mother she is, how incredible of a cook she is, how incredible of a hostess she is for holidays. She’s amazing in so many ways. \n\nI think I’m good looking but nothing special. I’m in good shape, but I’m going bald and I’ve aged. Most people would say this guy is punching above his weight. I was good with this for a long time, but I think as I started to feel somewhat insecure as I aged. I’m not particularly vain or anything but I looked for reassurance from her about my physical appearance. For the first time in my life, I felt insecure. I almost felt embarrassed. She didn’t come through for me, quite the opposite. She had never really complimented me about my appearance our whole relationship; maybe she’s just brutally honest idk. \n\nOne night after we were intimate, she told me how small I was. This was a completely unsolicited comment after 15+ years together. I think I’m average down there. I have measured myself and I’m just under 6 inches. I always thought she was pleased so hearing a complaint in that department was quite a blow. She later admitted she said it to hurt me out of some sort of anger. She wasn’t even sure what she was mad about. She’s tried to walk that back, but it’s been tough. \n\nNot long after that, I asked her what was physically attractive about me. I was just looking to feel better about myself. She told me there was nothing. Those were her words. And she was kind of shocked that I was taken aback by that and hurt by it. Hey, I asked, so I guess I deserve it. She’s tried to walk that back a lot over the years as well. Around that time, we went to dinner and I sort of said, hey I’m over 40, and for the first time ever, I’m feeling anxiety and stress over work, the kids, and life, etc. I asked if she could try to be more supportive and caring. She said no, that she was a good wife already and was providing support already. She couldn’t do anymore.\n\nWe actually talked through a lot of it. I expressed how it made me feel, she apologized for what she said. She’s actually way more giving of compliments than she has ever been. She has improved there. But it feels forced. Only being said cause I asked her too. Doesn’t always feel sincere. I have discussed it at length in therapy and I’m basically good with my appearance and what I can/cannot control, but I still think it was unnecessarily mean of her.\n\nMy wife has a massive fear of abandonment and has massive trust issues. She regularly accuses me of cheating. I have been nothing but faithful. I have to travel some for work, on average about 3 days a month, some months more and months less. She regularly wakes me up in the middle of the night to facetime to see if anyone is in my room. There has obviously never been. One night last year, I had to travel to give an important big presentation. Had to give it first thing in the AM. I prepared for weeks and it was stressful. I am presenting the work of my team so pressure is on me to show the good work everyone has done. My wife and I spoke around 10:00, talked for about a half hour and I went to bed. At 2:00 AM, I woke up to banging on the hotel door. She had somehow convinced the hotel manager (huge national hotel chain, so I’m not sure how this is compliant with their policies) to check on me because of an emergency. I realized I had maybe 10 missed calls and maybe 30 text messages from her. I had been asleep. So we facetime, we confirm there is no one there in the room with me. She wasn’t sorry or anything. She was mad that it took her so long to get ahold of me. I was now wide awake and had to give this presentation. Then had to work a full day, attend a work dinner, on basically 3 hours of sleep.\n\nMy wife has always been insanely jealous of other women. My first boss after college was like four years older than me. Her husband worked at the same company. My wife hated her, I guess cause I would talk about her. She was the person I worked closest with. I basically gave up any female friendships that I had, not that I was particularly close with any other women. One thing that was a particular issue for her was bachelor parties when all my friends were getting married. She hated the idea of me going to a strip club. Ok fine, I don’t particularly enjoy strip clubs. Nothing against the workers there, but I just see it as they just want my money and I don’t need to pay to see a really attractive woman. So anyway, neither of us had strippers or anything like that at our bachelor/bachelorette parties. I had a great time at mine. We played golf, went to an awesome dinner and then gambled afterwards. \n\nAnyway, some friends of mine did go to strip clubs for their bachelor parties. I always told my wife. And she wanted me to attend. I offered to skip or to skip that part, but I don’t think she wanted to be seen by my friends or the other wives as controlling or a stick in the mud. I really don’t know. But she wanted me to stay in contact the entire time. It was a little over the top but I did it. I would literally text her nearly the entire time I was there. Describing the situation, just talking about the night. Not sure why I even went to that part of the bachelor party. This happened 3 or 4 times. \n\nWhen I got home, I got the third degree. She examined me, smelled me. Examined my body for evidence, examined my underwear. It was crazy. Before the last one, I said I don’t want to do this. I don’t even want to go. But she didn’t want that, she wanted to go and stay in touch. She promised to back off some, but she didn’t really. At one point, a bouncer came over and told me to put the phone away when I was texting. So I did. I guess he was worried I was taking pictures. No, I wasn’t taking pictures, I was “staying in touch.” Typing this out makes me realize how ridiculous it was.\n\nAll of this would have been no big deal. These bachelor parties all happened over 10 years ago. Recently, she was talking about her BF’s bachelorette party which was years ago. My wife was the maid of honor. She had always insisted that she never went to a strip club ever. Well recently, my wife said something about the men pulling her friend up on stage and embarrassing her. I was like “where was this?” Even in that moment, I wouldn’t have cared that they went to a strip club. I trust her. Or until all this I fully trusted her. She insisted this was at a “typical bachelorette party restaurant” that wasn’t a strip club. I don’t know what that is. Does anyone know? \n\nI said that it felt like she wasn’t being honest. She was offended. I said that I thought that the real issue was that she thought I might have put her through the same thing she put me through. I said I didn’t like it, but it was so long ago, I don’t really care. But she doubled and tripled down. So she goes to the other room and texts her BF and comes back and hands me the phone to show me the texts. She asks the friend “did we go to a strip club for your bachelorette party?” which seems like an odd question to ask someone out of the blue, and the responses seemed odd. So I asked my wife “is this the full text exchange? It feels like something is missing.” So I look in her deleted texts, and sure enough there are deleted texts. I restore it and the response from the friend is “oh that is a definite yes!!!” So I look at my wife shocked. I don’t even know why she went down this path.\n\nShe says her friend is wrong. Now I’m annoyed and I’m asking what happened that you would lie about this? What did you do? Horror stories about bachelorette parties are running through my mind. We have an argument over this where I am gaslit to hell. Doesn’t remember, her friend is wrong, that’s why she deleted the text, she didn’t cheat or do anything wrong. All the comments about her level of attraction to me come back to my mind.\n\nNo real resolution, but she promises me that she will figure out exactly happened. Fast forward about a month to a holiday party we went to. We see her BF for the first time in a few months. Of course, they talk a lot amongst themselves which is obviously fine. We leave and twenty minutes later, we are in the car driving home and she gets a text. It’s from her BF. It includes a screen shot from one of their other friends and the BF texts says “[wife] and I just cannot remember what we did for my bachelorette party. Do you remember?” And the response is this whole description of a comedy show that they went to. The entire thing is so contrived, it’s almost comical. There is no way this is true and it is so clear that they discussed this at the party we were just at, and they came up with this plan. I feel so manipulated. My wife is in the passenger seat, and she is almost giddy reading the texts and saying how they have now solved the mystery.\n\nI have no idea what happened at that bachelorette party. But the whole story and the lying was so unnecessary. She’s still holding firm to her story, whatever it is. I wouldn’t have even cared if they went to a strip club cause I trusted my wife. But this story has made me lose trust. And now all the abuse over the years is coming back to me and making me see things differently.\n\nHave I ever been loved? Is my wife capable of love? Did she cheat on me? Am I the world’s biggest fool? I love her and the family we have created. Obviously there are so many positives to our relationship that I didn’t list. But can all the positives in the world make up for all this?\n\n**EDIT:** First, all comments and the DMs have been so caring and kind. Even the ones trying to smack some sense into me. There is a lot of love out there from kind strangers. Thank you.\n\nBased on an exchange in my DMs, I’m sharing that the physical abuse did stop five years ago. She worked with her former therapist who specialized in CBT and she is more in control of herself. I’m not sure she fully acknowledges the pain this has caused me (and the kids). And all this other nonsense has continued. I’m not sure this changes anything for me though.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/mmGmLrKAKy): **August 20, 2025 (6.5 months later)**\n\nWife’s disclosure\n\nI posted several months ago about my 20+ year marriage, and how much nonsense I have put up with. \n\nPeople mostly gave harsh but good advice to me. I wanted to give an update and come back for more advice.\n\nThis is long so feel free to skip of the ramblings of a middle aged dad of three aren’t of interest to you.\n\nSo back in February I insisted on a two month separation. We told the kids I was traveling for work, and when I was home, that my wife was traveling to meet friends. My wife hated every second of the separation.\n\nI had some conditions for returning. We tried marriage counseling again—third counselor. This one was better, I guess. But my requirement was that my wife take the lead: find the therapist, give all the backstory on the abuse, the insults, etc. She did all that.\n\nI further insisted that she tell the complete truth on anything inappropriate that has ever happened with another guy, including at her friend’s bachelorette party. This took a while. At first, she held to the same story. Then she started saying things like she was working on it with her therapist. Working on how to tell me. She somehow didn’t understand that a statement like that was awful for me to bear. Obviously my wind went to all the worst places.\n\nI ended the separation in April with the idea she was making progress. We discussed her physical abuse of me a lot in therapy. The abuse really peaked in late 2016-2018. She told me at that time that she became very resentful of me. I had gotten a promotion and she overall felt everyone thought I was awesome and she was jealous. At the same time, she got into excellent shape. She’s always been very attractive but at that time my youngest was like 6-8 years old and she still had some baby weight. She shredded that baby weight and looked incredible. I guess I had gained some weight around that time and she thought she didn’t get enough attention or credit relative to me. I don’t know. She says these things very matter of factly. She did a lot of CBT work and specific work for abusive partners. She owned it with the kids and we had several good conversations. I thought we were turning a corner.\n\nI had been frustrated by the lack of disclosure on her friend’s bachelorette party. So in June, I said I was leaving again. She actually handled this much more calmly and maturely. We still saw each other and even did date nights. We were even intimate. Not sure what the separation was. So she said she would focus on what happened and was getting ready to share anything and everything with me.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, she asked me to join a session with her therapist. She wanted to do a “therapeutic disclosure.” I wanted to throw up. I go to the therapists office and she proceeds to tell me how at her friend’s actual bachelorette, they went to some show, no strippers, just drinking and silliness. Then she says that her friend’s work friends threw her a bachelorette at a hotel. And there were strippers there. In my wife’s words it was wild. Now, context for this is in my prior post. I really don’t care if she saw strippers. I care more about the double standard she applied and the lying, as she treated me like crap whenever friends of mine went to strip clubs for their bachelor parties. She said that she never touched any stripper even though multiple approached her many times—at first in g-strings and eventually fully naked. Lovely. But that’s all that happened. Who knows if it’s true? I don’t care any more for reasons I’m about to get into.\n\nThis is all in front of this therapist. So then she says that I asked if there was anything with any guy that she hasn’t told me. If this wasn’t long enough, brace yourselves. She had this other friend who was in the middle of a divorce in 2016. Friend was a fitness instructor at a gym. Friend met a retired professional athlete at the gym. I remember the friend being obsessed with this guy, all while technically still married. Well, my wife and this friend would go out and meet up with retired athlete and his entourage. My wife would effectively play wingman for her friend. And one of the entourage took an interest in my wife. My wife claims nothing ever happened other than flirting but that when they were out, this guy always had his arm around my wife, constantly groped her her ass, often tried to kiss her, sent dick pics, bought her a thong bikini for her to send pics back to him. My wife said she never wanted it, but never fought it, liked the attention and mostly wanted to support her friend. Friend eventually had a falling out with the retired athlete who moved away. So that whole thing sucks.\n\nSo I’m completely stunned. Wife is crying. Therapist is spewing some nonsense about my wife’s bravery. That I requested disclosure of anything that might have been remotely inappropriate, and she has come through for me.\n\nI leave. Wife follows. Phone starts blowing up. It’s my wife’s best friend who calls 10 times. She then starts texting me. Swearing to me that what my wife is saying is true. There were strippers at bach party number 2 but wife did nothing. Texts start pouring in from her other friends confirming this story.\n\nAnd then I get a text from her friend who paired up with the athlete. And she confirms that story. Wife was only doing her a solid, taking one for the team.\n\nSo great. Let’s get a few more people involved in my life, my humiliation, the crumbling of my marriage. She could talk to all these other people about all this but not me. She needed a therapist there to talk to me about it. It just feels like one big manipulation.\n\nSo anyway, I feel completely done. I still love my wife cause I guess I’m just a simp. We are separated. I have spoken to a lawyer. My kids know and are furious with me cause I am the one leaving.\n\nBe kind to your partners people. Love them and respect them. I adored my partner and still do, but it wasn’t enough.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",

(In my opinion, and my parents opinion) \n\nAgainst my advice, they never even calculated their total bills to make sure they can fit a $2,000 mortgage comfortably. \nHe just kept saying “it will be fine.” \n\nWell shortly after buying the house, they financed two trucks (both $20,000 used). And with that, of course they had to get full coverage on both. \n\nWell he has a seasonal job. So during the winter he is off of work unless he finds a part time job somewhere, which he doesn’t do. \n\nAccording to my parents, they were a day away from being foreclosed on, when he went to our grandparents, cried on their couch, begging them to help. \n\nThe help was $7,000. The agreement was that they have to pay it back little by little each week. \n\nIt’s been 6 months and they’ve only paid $200 one single time. \n\nLast night my brother told me he bought a camper. For $2,000. AT THE (almost) END OF SUMMER. Okay. Whatever. You owe $7000, and are at risk of losing your house this winter as well, so yes of course it makes sense to spend 2k on something WHEN THAT MONEY COULDVE GONE TOWARDS SOMETHING THIS WINTER AT LEAST. 🙄\n\nI carry so much worry for him. He’s my little brother and I love him so much. But he’s constantly putting alcohol, partying, fun, above everything. \n\nNot to mention, they are currently on fertility medication to try to get pregnant. I CANT. \n\nI am so disappointed. I don’t want him to ruin is life with all of this debt they have. \n\nWhat should I do? An intervention? A long talk? Or just watch his life fall apart when he loses his house, vehicles, whatever else? \n\n\n\nEDIT: this post is not fake. They got married and bought the house in 2022. His wife is older than him. Has a good job. The seasonal job was at one point bringing in 100k a year. Work has slowed down all around us.",
